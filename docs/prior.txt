Priors

The priors object passed to :ref:`run_sampler <run-sampler>` is just a regular
`python dictionary <https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries>`_.

The keys of the priors objects should reference the model parameters (in
particular, the :code:`parameters` attribute of the :ref:`likelihood`. Each key
can be either

- fixed number, in which case the value is held fixed at this value. In effect,
  this is a Delta-function prior,
- or a :code:`tupak.prior.Prior` instance.

If the later, it will be sampled during the parameter estimation. Here is a
simple example that sets a uniform prior for :code:`a`, and a fixed value for
:code:`b`::

   priors = {}
   priors['a'] = tupak.prior.Uniform(minimum=0, maximum=10, name='a', latex_label='a')
   priors['b'] = 5

Notice, that the :code:`latex_label` is optional, but if given will be used
when generating plots.

We have provided a number of standard priors. Here is a complete list
